### What I learned

I was able to learn how to make a page responsive, i'v always had idea, but with the process being required to complete this project, it really gave opportunity to utilize and familiarize myself with it. Example below. Though, i mighty not be perfect yet, but i guess it's a start...

```css
@media (max-width: 1088px) {
  .lettering-div h2 {
    font-size: 15px;
  }
  .lettering-div p {
    font-size: 12px;
  }

  .main {
    height: 60%;
  }
}
```
